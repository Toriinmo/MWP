Hi, I'm a communications specialist with almost a decade of experience in media and communications. Over the years, I have helped brands create compelling messaging across platforms, and engaging diverse audiences. 

I hope to learn how to  write clearly and effectively for technical audiences from this technical writing bootcamp. I plan to build a strong foundation in technical writing that complements my communications background and opens up new career opportunities.
